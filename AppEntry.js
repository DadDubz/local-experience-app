// The entry point for the Expo app. This file is used to register the root component of the app.
// It ensures that the app is properly initialized and runs on both iOS and Android platforms.
// The `registerRootComponent` function is imported from the `expo` package and is used to register the main component of the app.
// The `App` component is imported from the `App.js` file, which contains the main logic and UI of the app.
// This file is typically used in Expo projects to set up the app's entry point and is automatically generated when creating a new Expo project.
